Four Computer vision application such as Face detection, Body detection, Car detection, and Object detection. The algorithm for each application are: 
1- Face detection. (Haar Cascades algorithm)
2- Car detection. (Haar Cascades algorithm) 
3- Body detection. (HOG algorithm)
4- Object detection. (CNN by YOLO)

For data science workload, we utilize Fitbit Fitness Tracker data.
